<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To all application owners,<br>
<br>
Security is the top-most priority of any organization. To ensure continued success in our drive to design and architect a secure infrastructure, we are implementing a 90-day automatic rotation of all AWS IAM User Access Keys.<br>
<br>
Why is this important and how does fixing this help you?<br>
Rotating Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials periodically will significantly reduce the chances that a compromised set of access keys can be used without your knowledge to access certain components within your AWS account.<br>
<br>
What this means for you:<br>
You will need to update your applications every 90-days with the new Access Key pair. These can be found in AWS Secrets Manager in a secret accessible by your application’s AWS IAM User only. You will have a grace period of 10 days after rotation before old Access Keys are disabled. There will be another 10-day grace period before old Access Keys are deleted. Until they are disabled, old Access Keys can be used to programmatically retrieve the new Access Keys from AWS Secrets Manager.<br>
<br>
Enabling this setting will also help you align with the following compliance standards:<br>
<br>
• The Center of Internet Security AWS Foundations Benchmark<br>
• APRA<br>
• MAS<br>
• National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)<br>
• AWS Well-Architected Framework</span></p>
